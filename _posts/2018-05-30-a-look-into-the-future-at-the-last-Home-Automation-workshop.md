# A look into the future at the last home automation workshop!

With a fantastic attendance we started our last workshop about home automation.

Also for this evening we found John taking care of the kickoff of this evening by giving a small presentation about the Software Defined Radio (SDR) and how you can analyze signals such as used with 433mhz domotica devices.

The LoRaWAN delegation, consisting of Marco and Frank from the community in Eindhoven, excited us this great innovative technology and what they created with that, together with the Internet of Things Network.

After a short break where we could stretch our legs a bit Richard from Smart Homes (that is the location where these workshops where organized) told us about the history and design choices that where made while they created (and still are) the house of the future. Richard closed up by giving us his professional view of the future of home automation and what to expect.

With that, sadly we came to the end of 5 consecutive workshops in the month of May by MADspace.
We would like to thank everybody for their participation (and donations!) and making these workshops a great succes, it really exceeded our expectations in so many ways.
Also, we would like to our hardware sponsors, with them the workshops could not have been given in such a pratical hands-on way.
And of course we like to mention the people who made these workshops possible, thank you Marco, John, Hans and Sander!

If you would like to know more about the topics of the home automation theme in general, take a look at MADspace.
Every Wednesday we come together although at the Lumensgroep building in Eindhoven (Don Boscostraat 4).
Please be advised that this location is soon to change as we are looking for a new location for this hackerspace (of possibly found one).

Here is short impression of the evening:
