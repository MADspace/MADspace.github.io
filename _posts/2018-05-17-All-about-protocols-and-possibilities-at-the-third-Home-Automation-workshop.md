# All about protocols and possibilities at the third Home Automation workshop

With the pleasure of good weather, beer & wine and some snacks, MADspace hosted their third domotica workshop last evening. It's great to see that so many enthusiastically keep coming back for these workshop with a lot of positive energy!

John once again kicked off the evening with a very complete and broad presentation about protocols, communication options and other technology options available today. After a short break, we followed up by Sander who dived deeper into 433mhz and Z-wave, giving a good and full picture about these technologies.

After that, we all took the liberty to start with our favorite project or device.
While some where running further experiments with their ESP8266 or LED lamp projects, others where exploring the possibilities of Z-wave and 433mhz technology.

A short impression of the evening:

## Upcoming workshops

Next week, the 4th workshop, we are going to combine all that we have learned so for by building the intelligence and automation in our domotica solutions.

For the last workshop plans are still somewhat open and free.
Richard, from the location "Het huis van de toekomst", will tell us about how they automated the house and what kind of solutions they integrated, including the KNX protocol. Others will show you what they are using as domotica solution (at home) and how they applied the technology.
If you have any specific subject you want to address or like to know more on, please let us know.
