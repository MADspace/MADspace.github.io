<p>Yesterday MADspace hosted the second workshop of in total 5 consecutive workshops regarding home automation and domotica.
Again we had a great turn-out, its was a full-house and â€˜ow boy, did we have funâ€™!</p>

<p>After a impressive presentation by John about the possibilities by using sensors, switches, actuators and other devices, we started by building our own sensor and switch.
Using nothing more then a breadboard, a sensor and LED, a few wires and resistors and of course a ESP8266 SoC, those who attended where able to build their own sensor from scratch.
By flashing and programming the ESP8266 chip and a readily provided Domoticz installation, it was fantastic to see everybody get a readout in Domoticz and able to switch the LED with a click of the mouse!
How great is that! And once youâ€™ve seen it, itâ€™s fairly easy to understand the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>Overal, the workshop was again a succes!</p>

<h2 id="upcoming-workshops">Upcoming workshops</h2>

<p>In the upcoming workshops we are going to further exploring the posibilities of domotica.</p>

<p>We are trying to cover as much as relevant and we have some fantastic ideaâ€™s for the upcoming workshops.
As such, we are still finetuning and preparing the content.
A further planning will follow, we will let you know on the mailing list.</p>
