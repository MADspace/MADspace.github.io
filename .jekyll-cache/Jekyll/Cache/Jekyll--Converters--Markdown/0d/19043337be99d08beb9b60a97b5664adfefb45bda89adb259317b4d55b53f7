<p>Another week in May, another home automation workshop!</p>

<p>Yesterday once again we all came together to share ideas and thoughts about home automation and what the possibilities are to put ‘the smart’ into domotica.</p>

<p>Where in previous workshops we played with sensors, switches and protocols, it all came together this workshop with powerful tools such as Block(l)y and alternatives.</p>

<p>Starting the evening with a presentation by John about Blocky or Blockly (we are still debating this…), Sander followed up with a demonstration about these technics and a quick overview of his personal Domoticz installation at home.
After this, Hans gave an impressive and comprehensive presentation about a few other languages that you can use in Domoticz including JSON, MQTT and Python.</p>

<p>Giving it a short break, we continued by taking the liberty to work on our own endeavors, ranging from playing with Block(l)y and the RFLink (Thank you Nodo-shop.nl!) to brave new experiments with 433mhz transceivers directly connected to a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Here is short impression of the evening:</p>
