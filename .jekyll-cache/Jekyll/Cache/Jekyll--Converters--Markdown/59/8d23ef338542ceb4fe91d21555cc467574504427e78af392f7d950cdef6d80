<h2>Aankondiging - Hacking Challenges (2019-07-31)</h2>

<p>Security skills are in high demand! As the world continues to turn everything into devices on the internet, the demand is only growing, so letâ€™s learn hacking! 
 The main idea is to learn how to play available online hacking games (just get better in it) and learn hacking :-)<br />
 We group with some fanatic people so we can learn from each other. The challenges are facilitated by Bram, who works as a security software engineer.</p>

<p>Expect an evening with other people playing hacking games both easy and moderate.</p>

<p>We help each other. <u><i> Bring your laptop and good mood.</i></u></p>
